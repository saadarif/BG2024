## Why are museum specimens valuable for DNA?

A global spatio-temporal record of populations and species, spanning 200 years.

::: incremental
-   useful for studying extinct, extirpated or threatened species/populations

-   building baselines or study long term changes

-   metagenomics

-   vertebrate bias in current musueum-based population genomic studies
:::

## What are the issues with historical DNA (hDNA)?

These are mostly similar to ancient DNA (**aDNA**) but perhaps not as exaggerated.

::: {.incremental .absolute bottom="130px"}
-   [Contamination]{.b .dark-red} - multiple sources
-   [DNA fragmentation]{.b .dark-red} - typically 50 bp fragments
-   [Deamination]{.b .dark-red} at 3' and 5' ends
-   [low yield]{.b .dark-red}
-   [Choice of tissue]{.b .dark-red}

## Dealing with hDNA extraction/library prep

-   [Choice of tissue]{.b .dark-red} - legs kept curator's happy, also gave use best libraries
-   [Contamination]{.b .dark-red} - workspace/tools only for museum samples, run & sequence [extraction blanks]{.b .green}
-   [Deamination]{.b .dark-red} - can be fixed fully or partially fixed with commercially available repair enzymes. [Dealt with at computational stage]{.b .green}.
-   [low yield]{.b .dark-red} - for our tissue (butterfly legs) a [qiagen tissuelyzer]{.b .green} prep worked best (further details in Rebecca's thesis).
-   [DNA fragmentation]{.b .dark-red} - problematic for **illumina library preparation** - difficult to separate adapter dimers in library prep, use [beads]{.b .green} for size selection and [titration of adapter]{.b .green} to reduce adapter contamination

## The "mysterious" disappearance of *Aporia crataegi* in Britain

-   Correspondence in the Entomological journals suggest that the butterfly was already disappearing from the western part of its range. Last sighting in Kent 1925 (Pratt 1983, *Entomologist's Rec. J. Var*)

-   Record of numerous releases within the 19th century - unclear if resident GB population survived into 20th century.

-   Debate on reasons of extinction:

    -   Avian predation
    -   fungal, viral or other pathogen
    -   Series of unfavorable *wet* Septembers

> "much mystery hangs over this species" - C.G. Barrett, 1893

## A genomic perspective on the mysterious disappearcne of *Aporia crataegi* in Britain

[Goals]{.b .bg-yellow}:

::: incremental
-   Were UK populations of *A. crataegi* distinct from European stock? Did they survive into the 20th Century?

-   Was the decline rapid or fast? For the latter we could expect to see no **genomic erosion**
    -   Compare relative genomic erosion in UK *A. crataegi* to mainland European pop. Perform same analysis for a demographically stable species (*Polyommatus icarus*) to provide some context.

-   Is there any evidence for a role of pathogen infection in the extirpation of UK butterflies?

::: {.absolute bottom="100px"}
-   Sampled specimens only where [collection year]{.b .bg-teal} and [locality]{.b .bg-teal} was available
-   1-2 legs per butterfly dissected
:::

## Sampling and Methods: Sequencing Library Prep

::: incremental
-   [DNA extraction:]{.b .bg-yellow}
    -   one or two legs macerated using Tissuelyser II bead mill (Qiagen) and finished with QIAamp DNA Micro kit (Qiagen)
-   [Library preparation:]{.b .bg-yellow}
    -   NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit using a modified CUT&RUN procotol
    -   Exclusion of adapter dimers using SPRIselect beads and titrating primer content
    -   10-12 PCR cycles depending on input template amount
    -   dual indices
-   [Sequencing:]{.b .bg-yellow}
    -   High quality genome assembly and annotation via Darwin Tree of Life
    -   individual libraries pooled in equimolar ratio
    -   extraction blanks pooled in 1:10 ratio for controls
    -   PE150 bp sequencing at Novogene

:::

## Sampling and Methods: Data Analysis

::: incremental
-   [Population Structure]{.b .bg-yellow} - [plinkPCA]{.prog} and [angsdPCA]{.prog} (for low coverage data)

-   [Historical demography]{.b .bg-yellow} - [PSMC]{.prog} on highest coverage genomes available

-   [Genetic diversity]{.b .bg-yellow} - individual heterozygosity estimated with [angsd]{.prog}

-   [Inbreeding]{.b .bg-yellow} - Runs of homozygosity determined with [plinkPCA]{.prog}

-   [Genetic load]{.b .bg-yellow} - predicted LOF, missense and synonymous variants with [snpEFF]{.prog}

-   any statistical analysis is either a *t*-test or when comparing samples with variable coverage, a linear model with coverage covariate.

## Conclusions

- Resident [GB]{.bg-gb} *A. crataegi* survived into 20th century, however 2/4 20th century samples are likely of [EU]{.bg-eu} ancestry

-  *A. crataegi* underwent severe bottlneck at time of colonisation and never seems to have recovered

-  Increases in homozygosity suggest a spasmodic rather than instant decline in the 19th-20th century

-  Increase in homozygous **missense** mutations may have made population more prone to extinction

-  Consistent differences in genomic erosion suggest these metrics could be helpful to monitor or identify threatened insect populations/species with a small number of individuals.

-  What was the ultimate cause of the regional extinction?
    - at least two other Butterfly species disappeared from the UK around the same time

## Further work: Metagenomics

::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
![](images/overview_heatmap_scores.png)
:::

::: {.column width="25%" .fragment}
- *Aspergillus sp.* are known to be entomopathogenic but they are quite common and potentially might be *perimortem* or *postmortem* contamination

- more work needed

## The future: Functional Genomics in museum specimens

- Genome-wide methylation is possible from veretbrate museum specimens

## What is Genomic Erosion and why it matters?

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   The loss of genetic fitness in small populations due to a shrinking 'gene pool', but measured by genetic variation

-   The promise of conservation genomics lies in the link between genomic variation and genetic fitness, as the latter is potentially *measurable*
